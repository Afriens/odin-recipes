    <h4>This layered Peruvian potato and chicken salad is called "causa rellena" in Peru.</h4>
    <p>There's nothing very unusual about serving a chicken or potato salad at a cookout but this beautiful layered salad is sure to cause a stir! </p>
    <p>Perfect for making ahead and packing in your cooler on a hot summer day. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and cilantro if desired.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Chicken Salad:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large cooked chicken breast, diced or shredded</li>
        <li>¼ cup green peas</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced cooked carrot</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced shallot</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped roasted red peppers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lime juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Potato Mixture:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons aji amarillo chili paste, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>cayenne pepper to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 avocado, quartered and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sour cream (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 small clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons aji amarillo chili paste, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken, green peas, carrot, shallot, roasted red peppers, cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl. Season with salt and cayenne. Add mayonnaise and mix until combined. Cover chicken salad with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes into a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until very tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. Drain well and transfer potatoes to a mixing bowl. Mash until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add ají amarillo, olive oil, and lime juice to the potatoes. Season with cayenne and salt. Mash together with a potato masher. Switch to a spatula and mix until completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Line four 6-ounce ramekins with plastic wrap. Scoop mashed potatoes evenly into ramekins; press and smooth out the tops. Cover each with a layer of avocado slices. Fill each ramekin to the top with chicken salad, pressing it down and pulling up the plastic wrap to eliminate any air pockets. Cover with a final layer of mashed potatoes, going up to 1/2 inch or more over the rim.</li>
        <li>Seal top with a new layer of plastic wrap and fold the sides over to seal. Refrigerate salads until completely chilled, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, sour cream, garlic, and ají amarillo together for the sauce, adding a splash of water to adjust the thickness.</li>
        <li>Remove the top layer of plastic wrap from each salad. Invert each ramekin onto a serving plate; remove ramekins, then plastic wrap. Spoon some sauce around each salad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Chef's Note:</h4>
    <p>If you can't find ají amarillo, you can make a paste from some fire-roasted and peeled orange or red bell peppers, with red Fresno chilies for some heat. While this does get you close, you should definitely try to find a jar of the real stuff, since it does have such a unique flavor.</p>
