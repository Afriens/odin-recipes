    <h3>This layered Peruvian potato and chicken salad is called "causa rellena" in Peru.</h3>
    <p>There's nothing very unusual about serving a chicken or potato salad at a cookout but this beautiful layered salad is sure to cause a stir! </p>
    <p>Perfect for making ahead and packing in your cooler on a hot summer day. Garnish with cherry tomatoes and cilantro if desired.</p>
