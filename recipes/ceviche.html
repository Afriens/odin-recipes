    <h4>This ceviche is the best you will ever have. It is from Peru and I love making it every time I have friends and family over.</h4>
    <p>This recipe for Peruvian fish ceviche is prepared with fresh fish, limes, onions, spicy peppers, and fresh cilantro. Ceviche, also known as ceviche or seviche, usually consists of seafood that is marinated with lime juice, the acidity of the lime juice actually “cooks” the seafood. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 potatoes</li>
        <li>2 sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 red onion, cut into thin strips</li>

        <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh tilapia, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the potatoes and sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Simmer until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, then drain, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Place the sliced onion in a bowl of warm water, let stand 10 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place the lime juice, celery, cilantro, and cumin into the bowl of a blender, and puree until smooth. Pour this mixture into a large glass bowl, and stir in the garlic and habanero pepper. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the diced tilapia and shrimp.</li>
        <li>Set aside to marinate for an hour, stirring occasionally. The seafood is done once it turns firm and opaque.</li>
        <li>To serve, peel the potatoes and cut into slices. Stir the onions into the fish mixture. Line serving bowls with lettuce leaves. Spoon the ceviche with its juice into the bowls and garnish with slices of potato.</li>
